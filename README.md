Rolling Pebbles Band Website


This is my first project for Code Institute, I was tasked with developing a website for a band.
I didnt want to use templates or any pre existing code to create the website so
I coded it all in HTML and CSS from scratch.

I wanted to display the bad and have a booking page and a small store/merchandise page.
The webpage is designed to give the user a taste of what sort of image and music the band produce.

While there is a sample song, a video and clickable links, there isn't a functioning shopping cart
because this isnt covered until later modules and I viewed the task as a basic one to 
use and show off my html and css skills.

If the Band existed then I would get real footage and music to put on the website as well as
images of the actual merchandise for sale.

The step after that would be to create a shopping cart using stripe and creating a user login,
register, and logout function with automated emails when purchases are made.
